# Substack downloader

### To-do

Fix:

- [ ] More robust strategy to save location in article
- [ ] Brush up comments loading

Add:

- [ ] Export list of articles in markdown

**From ACX:**
- there should be a way to browse acx using your app. (i clicked on the link on top and got back to the real acxpage outside of your app with no way of coming back to your app)
- and i would like to give private tags to users, which should be shown next to their name for each of their comment.
