# Substack downloader

### To-do

Fix:

- [ ] More robust strategy to save location in article
- [ ] Brush up comments loading
- [ ] No more `db.open()`

Add:

- [ ] Export list of articles in markdown

**From ACX:**
- ~~there should be an indication, that comments are being loaded, i.e. when i clicked your link, it said something "no comments found", and i thought your webapp was broken so i navigated away. (then i tried again acouple of times and eventually realized, that the loading time is just long)~~
- there should be a way to browse acx using your app. (i clicked on the link on top and got back to the real acxpage outside of your app with no way of coming back to your app)
- ~~there should be a "reply on substack" button, that links back to substack, so i can write a reply to a specific comment on the original substack app, where i am logged in.~~
- ~~by default long comments should be reduced to a couple of lines and there should be a info about how many lines are hidden. (i decide if i read a long comment based on the replys it got, so I would first look at the length of a comment then at the first couple replys, and only then would i unfold the top comment)~~
- and i would like to give private tags to users, which should be shown next to their name for each of their comment.
